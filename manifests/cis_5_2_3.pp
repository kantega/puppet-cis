# 5.2.3 Ensure permissions on SSH private host key files are configured (Scored)
#
# Description:
#
# An SSH private key is one of two files used in SSH public key authentication. In this
# authentication method, the possession of the private key is proof of identity. Only a private
# key that corresponds to a public key will be able to authenticate successfully. The private
# keys need to be stored and handled carefully, and no copies of the private key should be
# distributed.
#
# Rationale:
#
# If an unauthorized user obtains the private SSH host key file, the host could be
# impersonated
#
# @summary 5.2.3 Ensure permissions on SSH private host key files are configured (Scored)
#
# @example
#   include cis::5_2_3
class cis::cis_5_2_3 (

# 4.2.3 Ensure permissions on all logfiles are configured (Scored)
#
# Description:
#
# Log files stored in /var/log/ contain logged information from many services on the system,
# or on log hosts others as well.
#
# Rationale:
#
# It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive
# data is archived and protected.
#
